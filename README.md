## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the basics of Bootstrap by doing this project. I use their cdn and add some custom styles as well. I follow the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for building this page.

### Continued Development

This is my first bootstrap site and I really enjoy doing this. I will try to use this framework for some rapid building. But with bootstrap I feel like I set a limit for my overall mockup.
